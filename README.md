I'd prefer that there wouldn't be unnecessary issues, but if there's a real problem with the functionality of the site, please do submit one. Otherwise, you can open one too, but no promises that I'll implement it.
# What I learned - 📚
After repeated requests that I build a proper portfolio and several design overhauls, I've settled on this design.  
It features :
- Smexy smexy backgrounds, hand designed by yours truly
- An attempt at a PHP email request (it was copy pasted from somewhere eheh)
- Grid technologies
- Perpetual dark mode for our fellow night owls
- My very big brain 🧠
# Contacts, TL;DR
Normally, I'd have a `How It Works` section here, but it's just HTML. Any twelve-year-old [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) user can figure it out. So, here's a bunch of my contacts and other website-related informations.  
Discord : `kewbish#2255`  
Email : `kewbish@gmail.com`  
Reddit : `u/kewbish`  
TL;DR : Hire me. [PayPal me here.](https://paypal.me/KEWB1SH). Feed my Steam Wallet. :) 

Happy coding! 👋
