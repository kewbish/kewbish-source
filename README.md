Made in HTML, July 2019 to present.  
Released under the [GNU License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).  
I'd prefer that there wouldn't be unnecessary issues, but if there's a real problem with the functionality of the site, please do submit one. Otherwise, you can open one too, but no promises that I'll implement it.  
My next plan for this site is evaluating whether or not I should move it to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.
# What I learned - 📚
After repeated requests that I build a proper portfolio and several design overhauls, I've settled on this design.  
It features :
- Repeating backgrounds, hand designed by yours truly
- Grid technologies
- Perpetual dark mode for our fellow night owls
# Contacts, TL;DR
Normally, I'd have a `How It Works` section here, but it's just HTML. Any twelve-year-old [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org) user can figure it out. So, here's a bunch of my contacts and other website-related informations.  
Discord : `kewbish#2255`  
Email : `kewbish@gmail.com`  
TL;DR : Hire me. [PayPal me here.](https://paypal.me/KEWB1SH). Feed my Steam Wallet. :) 

Happy coding! 👋
