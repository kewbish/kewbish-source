Made with HTML + Hugo, July 2019 to present.  
This is the source of my site - [check it out!](https://kewbish.github.io)

I'd prefer that there wouldn't be unnecessary issues, but if there's a real problem with the functionality of the site, please do submit one. Otherwise, you can open one too, but no promises that I'll implement it.  

# Contacts
Normally, I'd have a `How It Works` section here, but it's simple HTML that I hope anyone can understand. So, here's a bunch of my contacts and other website-related informations.  
Email : `kewbish@gmail.com` 
Discord : `kewbish#2255`   
LinkedIn: [/in/kewbish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kewbish/)  

Happy coding! 👋
