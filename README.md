# kewbish.github.io - 🌐
Made with HTML, July 2019 to present.  
Currently undergoing construction - please forgive any issues as I work to improve the site.  
Released under the [GNU License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).  
I'd prefer that there wouldn't be unnecessary issues, but if there's a real problem with the functionality of the site, please do submit one. Otherwise, you can open one too, but no promises that I'll implement it.  
My next plan for this site is evaluating whether or not I should move it to <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>.
# What I learned - 📚
After repeated requests that I build a proper portfolio and several design overhauls, I've settled on this design.  
It features :
- Repeating backgrounds, hand designed by yours truly
- Grid technologies
- Perpetual dark mode for our fellow night owls
# Contacts
Normally, I'd have a `How It Works` section here, but it's simple HTML that I hope anyone can understand. So, here's a bunch of my contacts and other website-related informations.  
Email : `kewbish@gmail.com` 
Discord : `kewbish#2255`   
LinkedIn: [/in/kewbish](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kewbish/)  
TL;DR : Hire me. [PayPal me here.](https://paypal.me/KEWB1SH). Feed my Steam Wallet. :) 

Happy coding! 👋
