            <h2>Contributing and volunteering experience.</h2>
            <p>In 2019, I was a 🏆 <a href="https://g.co/gci">Google Code-in</a> winner, under Liquid Galaxy. For two months, I completed many open source tasks, and eventually won this worldwide competition. I'm one of Canada's six winners to date, the only female, and the youngest Canadian winner. As well: I was the youngest winner in 2019. Pretty cool.</p>
            <p>Giving back to the community is one of my core values. Aside from my contributions to open source, I also frequently volunteer in-person.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Intern at 🌎 <a href="https://liquidgalaxy.eu">Liquid Galaxy</a>, a Google-backed open source organization focused on interactive, immersive geographical displays.

                <li>Teen Advisory Member at the 📙 <a href="https://vpl.ca">Vancouver Public Library</a>, the local library serving Vancouver community members.
