## Introduction
The `#shecoded` movement, as far as I can see, started on popular developer blogging site [Dev.to](https://dev.to). 
[Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/) is on March 8th, and female- and non-binary identifying individuals are encouraged to share their developer stories. See some of the other stories [on their landing page](https://dev.to/shecoded), and check them out!

## Nevertheless, Kewbish Coded
Online, I go by Kewbish, so I'll continue that here, I guess. I'm from the PNW, Canada, and it's been a great developer journey for me.  

I started programming at the wee age of 11, and it's only been a few years since I started developing. It seems like it's been ages-  

I began my journey as a budding game developer, working with [Gamemaker, back when it was still free.](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker). Next, my parents brought me to a local coding school, where I bumbled through [Unity](https://unity.com) for a few years. However, I was tired of learning in this traditional environment, and decided to strike out on my own, creating simple web pages with vanilla HTML and CSS. I then had a console program stage, where I created bad ASCII games with C#. Frustrated with the lack of libraries and obvious applications, I moved to Python, and I guess that brings me to where I am. (Started with open source rather recently as well, due to [Hacktober](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) and other initiatives, like [Google Code-in](https://kewbish.github.io/blog/posts/200214//).)

The primary technologies I work with are:  
	- [Python](https://python.org) - usually for data science with [numpy](https://numpy.org) and [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and GUIs with [Tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter) and recently, [Kivy](https://kivy.org)
	- Web stuff - for now, HTML and CSS, planning to look into [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) soon
	- Whatever else I want to learn: right now, I have a really huge list, from [C++](https://isocpp.org) to [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) to JS frameworks, and everything in between.

Learning is a big part of what I'd like to blog about in the future, and why I began writing devlogs again. I love the idea of [public learning](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/), and that's a philosophy powering quite a bit of my work.  

I'm still young (criticize me for wasting my life away on the interwebs all you want), so I haven't experienced the constant pressure spurred by my gender identity that seems to be prevalent in every tech company, according to the Internet. I can't say I've been 100% respected everywhere I apply myself, but it's not hard for me to brush remarks off. I shouldn't have to tolerate them, but in the meantime, I think that ignoring the voices and powering through is a solid strategy. The posts on the Internet are many, but I'm sure that moving forward, the number of allies, equitable companies, and good experiences will number even more. 

## Equality in tech is…
Equality in tech is the implementation of equity where able, while not then over-favouring one race/gender/identity over others.  
Equality in tech is the power to speak out, and the power to listen to and respect opinions that are not your own.  
Equality in tech is a hand-up when needed, and offering that help to others when they, in turn, need it.  
Equality in tech is the opportunities given equally and equitably, blind to any forms of discrimination.  

## I'm an expert at…
Nothing, really. I've come a long way from the smol kewbish I once was, but at the same time, I've so far to go. I have time, and I'll make the most of it. That's all I can do.  

## My advice for allies…
There is no formula where a company can plug in an X and get a reliable derivative of allies or something, but I can try to give some advice.  

Work with the person, as a person. Focus on what they've done well, but encourage them to improve and step out of their comfort zone.  

Providing support is a good step. Support alone can make a huge difference. However, evaluate how someone receiving support feels getting the help they need, be it a code review or a mental health break. Put yourself in their shoes.  

Include everyone, if possible. Equity and equality have many values I agree with, but the form of equality present in certain work environments or events don't work. Give underrepresented groups opportunities, but balance these. Does it make sense for an all-girls learning group to convene, while males aren't given this opportunity at all? Just something to consider.  

## The most rewarding thing I've done this year is…
I've said this before, and I'll say it again: Google Code-in has been an amazing opportunity. Working through all my obstacles, learning to persevere, and pushing through - it all paid off. I'm super happy to represent as one of the few women, and one of two winners from Canada. The message here really is to take that first step, even if you don't want to. I'd also consider this my `recently-i-overcame` section, due to the sheer literage of tears shed and heightened heart rate.  

## Ode to the Internet
Recently, for a school assignment, I wrote a sonnet about something I loved - the Internet, and its powers. I thought it'd be fitting to share here.  

`Ode to the Internet  `
```text
Away the chiclet squares sing, tap, and clack  
Ups and downs, orange and blue, decide all  
The bitter mob assembles for attack  
A simple matter then becomes a brawl  
Identities mapped out, charts with red tacks  
To their safe havens, wounded soon will crawl  
Who knew the links would lead to a hijack?  
Forged to delight, forgetting the pitfalls \  

Yet we connect, share, organize, and laugh  
Collaborate on software, saving lives  
From coast to coast, through the web, all are free  
To access catalogs of books and graphs  
Let not a scornful word become a knife  
Empower each of us - the web's decree. 
```

## Conclusion
To all of us, working through struggles, be they material or emotional: we will prevail. To all of us, considering exploring something new: do not be afraid. To all of us, living, developing, and creating: we face challenges, but nevertheless, we code.
