## Introduction
Disclaimer: I don't use a Mac. I do have an iPhone as my daily driver phone, but that'll change soon - I think.

Recently, I was working on [Opus](https://github.com/kewbish/opus), which was supposed to be an elegant, minimal book-tracker for personal usage. It was my first foray into [Kivy](https://kivy.org) - but it was cut short quite quickly. I could debug and test features and sizing on my laptop development environment, but the end use case was meant to be on my phone. Yeah, I'm aware - Android is superior and all, but I got an iPhone from my parents, and I'm not going to complain. (Side note: I'll be getting a Pixel 4XL soon [hopefully] as one of the *aLtErNaTe prizes* for Google Code-in 2019. Don't even start me on the rant - I'm sure the other winners and I can go on for ages.) Once I was finished the bulk of the app, I wanted to implement a platform-specific feature with Kivy's [iOS toolchain](https://github.com/kivy/kivy-ios/tree/master/recipes/ios/src), but lo and behold: I found that I couldn't compile it.  

I run Windows (and WSL / various VMs), which aren't supported by Xcode and whatever else I needed to compile with. Mac-lockdown, time and time again.  

Fine, I thought. I implemented the feature (which was the [email bit](https://github.com/kewbish/opus/commit/acd538f3c6e347d16d921a890b4d61af7068dbc1), if you're wondering) with a non-native library, and moved on with my development.  

Then, it came to final compiles. I looked everywhere for instructions on how to compile for iOS, and found zero working workarounds. I simply just couldn't compile my app for iOS because I **didnâ€™t run macOS, and I don't have a Mac**.  

## Vendor Lock-in To the Max
When you buy a Mac, you get a great (in terms of Mac) consumer tool. Fine, fine. Work ahead. But to get the most of your Apple Experience, you buy an iPad to take notes and draw with. Your Android smartphone isn't looking so hot anymore - time to replace it with an iPhone.  

Most of the people I know personally who have a Mac as their main desktop environment end up becoming Apple fan-people. At least, they have several Apple devices.  

And to me, this is one of the biggest gripes I have with Apple. I shouldn't have to invest (way too much, may I add) in a fully-vertically-integrated Apple tech system to get the perks of one device. I acknowledge that the iPad's seen as the de-facto tablet leader for notetaking. Fine - but you shouldn't have to buy into all these other systems to get the most out of one.  

## Big Guns with Small Usability
MacOS, in particular, was created on the basis of [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix). This makes the environment closer to what a Linux install would be like. Their terminal is what is usually depicted in tech tutorials - understandably so: the UI/UX is pretty sweet. When I became a *1337coderhax0rboi*, I looked for a macOS terminal download - for Windows.  

But the problem with the power is - at least from what I see, is it's hidden under layers and layers of bubblegum and lollipops. To make the entire experience more streamlined and less intimidating for non-technical people, they've shed a lot of the superuser features.  
And if they're there - why hide them?  

From what I've heard, the OS's isolated to learn. It's not quite like any Linux distro, but it lacks the boring, cookie-cutter usability of Windows systems. I consider myself quite techy, and at summer school, I couldn't learn how to navigate and get to the level I needed to be for a serious development situation in *three weeks*.  
## Software - Expanded
To develop on Apple systems (more on this below), you usually have to use Xcode and Swift (or whatever dependencies you need - I don't know, because I *don't have access to the environments needed*)  

Many beginner coders are interested with what *they* interact with on a daily basis. Of course, this happens to sometimes be the apps that populate their phone, that they spend too much time on. And that's great! Building something and understanding what you use frequently helps you appreciate the work and backend that you interact with daily.  
But they'll quickly find out that - if they have an iPhone but not a MacBook - they're out of luck. Why does Apple feel the need to close their doors to so many budding developers? A 2019 Macbook Pro costs from $1700, essentially. This cutoff removes so many from the developer pool.  

And even if they do happen to have all the hardware required, an Apple Developer license costs $99 per year. It's a subscription. And while I understand subscription models are great for revenue, it also cuts off many developers from being able to benefit your system.  

In a way, iOS development is becoming a great area to enter - just because there's such a high barrier. Is this what you wanted, Apple? So many end up priced out of a career or interest they'd like to pursue. Either they sacrifice specs, or what they want to do.  

## The Split
My personal situation is an awkward one. I run Windows / Linux on my laptop, and have an iPhone. Until I get an Android device, I'm not able to fully utilize my skills or experiment with the technologies I'd like to go into.  

And I simply just don't know what to do. I can make the apps, debug them on my laptop, but I don't have the users or testers to really support on either Android or Apple. I can't compile for what I use daily, and I don't have the hardware to compile for what's more open and to what I'd want to target.

The entire system just feels *arrogant*. Apple users are now some 'exclusive' club, with the means to afford the slick devices, but haven't established themselves as powerusers either.  

Many people (around 15% according to a cursory Google search) use an iPhone, and while this is low, you have to consider that tonnes more have other Apple devices. It seems that more than half the people I know use a iPhone as a daily driver phone. Would you, as a budding developer, want to miss out on all those users?  

I'm not going to bite the bullet and enter the Apple world anytime soon. Yes, it's a pain to build something and not be able to personally test or use anything you create - but it's something I'll have to deal with. I don't want to invest in a $100 per year license to something that costs, what, $25 with Android. I'll focus my efforts on Python and desktop environments now - thanks.

## What Apple *is* Good At
Apple does have a couple great things under their belt. I won't soliloquy on them here: you'll be able to find tonnes of Apple-supporter content on the interwebs.
However, from a Windows-combo-Linux user, here are some of the things I feel that Apple does well.
- UI. Their UI styles are consistent and honestly, very nice on the eye.  
- A smaller perk: but I love their centered taskbar. I tried to mock together something similar with my own machine.

- A cohesive, integrated environment. Yes, it's unfortunately very exclusivized, but it *is* well-integrated.
- Marketing and business work. Of course, being a huge multi-million company does help, but their ads and marketing are *chef's kiss*.

## An Open Request
A couple things I'd like Apple to consider:
- Reducing, or adding a student plan, to the Apple Developer plan
- Making Xcode available for Windows and Linux
- Opening up barriers to entry for all sorts of Apple development
- Allow options for current users to port to software or tools that aren't made by Apple / proprietary
- Making an .iso for VMs to run, or creating a free / minimally-priced VM system

## Currently
I'm developing [Kenna](https://github.com/kewbish/kenna) right now. Later, it'll be used hopefully by one of my teachers in an effort to cut down on the amount of paper used. I'm playing around with Hugo and NetlifyCMS right now, but I'm also toying with the idea of a custom-written Python static-site-generator coupled with a HTML / PHP CMS for editing. Stay tuned to my GitHub - you can watch me struggle in all my commits.  

In other news, I'm continuing to work on [Justin](https://github.com/kewbish/justin), my personal assistant CLI tool. I just added a couple of GitHub functions as of the time of writing, and I'm planning on automating a bunch of other workflows I have with it as well.
