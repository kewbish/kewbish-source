## Introduction
Recently, I began a new blog, hosted on GitHub Pages over [here](http://kewbish.github.io/blog). In the past, I've tried (and eventually failed) to set up a devlog section on my site, and one of the main pain points was the repetitiveness of creating and pushing content. I had a template with very bare-bones HTML and CSS that I copied and pasted my work into, but this was annoying to constantly try to move my plaintext into rich HTML content. I ended up destroying the repo because it just became a burden to write for and maintain content for, which turned me off blogging or creating any internet content, basically, for about a year. However, with my [recent GCI win](https://kewbish.github.io/blog/posts/200214//index.html), I felt that I needed to step up my digital presence and start devlogging for real.    

## Looking for a SSG
Firmly entrenched in the idea of starting a blog and [publicly learning](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/), I began searching for some sort of generation tool.  

Briefly, I considered biting the bullet and starting a [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) site. However, after a couple seconds of reconsidering (goddammit Kewbish, do you really want to do this?), I immediately discarded the idea. Having worked with Wordpress (and [Weebly, if anyone cares](https://lienotly.weebly.com)), I knew how boring creating a site there would be, especially without the ability to fine-tune files and configure my site exactly as I liked it. As well, it would add a lot of bloat and annoyance to initial setup. Besides, then I'd have to deal with another subdomain - (shut up, I'll get a domain soon).  

Platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com) and [Dev.to](https://dev.to) allow an easy startup, but it wouldn't allow me to change much styling, and I'd either get stuck behind a paywall somewhere (Medium) or be limited quite a bit to a developer audience (Dev.to). These platforms would give me a great starting readerbase and starting point, though I guess my inner demon-angel wouldn't let me do anything less than sink a week into learning something new.

The logical next step for me was a SSG (**S**tatic **S**ite **G**enerator). I'd heard of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and its integration with GitHub Pages made it attractive, but the startup of having to install Ruby, a language I'd not used (and frankly, don't plan on using) made me reluctant.

[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) had a great community, and its clear documentation brought it up as a good choice. However, despite my experience with web development, I've chosen to steer relatively far away from JS-based tools (and haven't touched Node at all yet. One of the items on my ever-growing to-do list.) Therefore, I felt I should keep looking.  

## Choosing Hugo
Enter [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Hugo seemed like an amazing compromise: easy startup (though I'd have to handcode a theme) and relatively low bloatage. (As well, the community around the tool and its frequent maintenance made it extremely attractive.)

With Hugo in hand, I set up to create the blog of my dreams.

## Site Setup
I'm familiar with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), so writing for Hugo's Markdown-based generator wasn't a challenge. In fact, the most difficult part of the whole setup was probably theme development.  

**Theme Development** - The prideful human I am, I couldn't just use a *premade theme* ([of which there are plenty, if you were wondering](https://themes.gohugo.io/)). (Oh, the *horror*.)  

I started off then with a basic theme, and created the Markdown first. Then, I began styling my site with some basic CSS. It's still pretty bare-bones, but I feel like it's good enough for my basic purposes.  

I'm still pretty new to [Go's Templating tools](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/), but the Hugo documentation more-or-less described most of the variables I needed, as well as linking to forum posts detailing some of the features I implemented. Again, the [community](https://discourse.gohugo.io) is amazing, and super active.  

**Deployment** - `++` to Hugo for providing a commit script. I have a recreation [here](https://github.com/kewbish/blog/blob/master/deploy-blog.cmd) for their `gh-pages` deployment solution, for all y'all Windows folks. Overall, this part's relatively easy to follow, as long as you're Terminal / Command Prompt savvy.  

I would have liked some sort of inbuilt hugo command for this, but porting the bash script to batch wasn't difficult, and generally ended up fine. I definitely recommend familiarizing yourself with [worktree](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) before attempting a GitHub Pages deploy.  

## Using a SSG
Having had both a handcoded blog and now this SSG site, I definitely prefer the workflow of the SSG. The ability to create custom themes brings the aesthetics to the level of a handcoded website, adding the [DRY principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Simply creating and formatting a MD file is a lot easier to manage than copy-pasting a bunch of components from hand-made templates. Besides, Hugo allows [partials](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/) and other inbuilt templates-inside-templates, and *everything is customizable*.  

The following are some common cons, and what I have to say.
	- **SSGs are difficult to learn.** False, actually. If you've some Markdown knowledge, and basic experience with HTMl / CSS (what you'd need for a handcoded approach anyway), you can learn Hugo. Hugo, in fact, is packaged into a single binary, and doesn't require other installs, unlike some other SSGs.  
	- **Every time I deploy, I have to rebuild.** This is true, but I find the Hugo workflow better than the handcoded approach, especially with automation scripts.  
	- **SSGs work with files, instead of a database.** This is a minor pain point, and means that as my blog grows, I'll need to manage my files well, instead of just tucking them into a database somewhere. However, I argue that this leads you to think about file structure design before the issues build up, and construct a scalable system in the beginning.   
	- **No one's ever heard of SSGs besides technical people.** Wordpress, for sure, is a major player in the non-handcoded-site industry, but I feel the powers of open source and community outweigh the market strategy. Anyways, if I can build the same thing, there's no point in switching if all else equal.  
	- **Team and user management is nonexistent.** In the traditional sense, yes, there can't be `admin`s and `writer`s and whatevers as you do with Wordpress or Weebly. However, hosting on a platform like GitHub Pages opens up even more possibilities, giving you the tools to collaborate even more.   

## Conclusion
My migration process (or initialization process ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) was relatively painless, and I prefer the workflow to that of a handcoded experience. Hugo provides a great, open source framework for blogging and deployment to GitHub Pages (major `++`), which is what I use anyway.  

Stop by and check the [blog](https://kewbish.github.io/blog) out, and if there are any errors anywhere, open an issue and let me know!

## Currently
I've just finished [GCI](https://g.co/gci), and have the [VDSF](https://vdsf.sfiab.com) soon, so I'm speedrunning my project and polishing it up. If you're interested, the [source is available on GitHub](https://github.com/kewbish/CSRNG).  

Otherwise, I'm in a bit of a quandary on projects, but I think I'm going to continue [Opus](https://github.com/kewbish/opus), a book tracking system I'll build based on what I need personally. For that project, I'll be using [Kivy](https://kivy.org) to create an iOS app (don't worry, it'll be on Android too, but I won't release it on the Play Store).  

Recently, I've been thinking more about what I'd like to specialize in - web development, Python, some combination of the two, or delve deeper into lower-level languages and technologies. For now, I'll continue with what I'm familiar with, which happens to be web technologies, but I'm seriously considering learning C++ or perhaps some sort of machine learning project. [Tensorflow's](https://tensorflow.org) been on my list for ages as well.  
Just some thoughts.
