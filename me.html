        <div class="description">
          <p>I got tired of being force-fed code, so I decided to teach myself web design. With the help of
            <a href="https://khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>, <a href="https://w3schools.com">W3 schools</a>, <a
              href="https://udemy.com">a rather childish course on Udemy</a>, various <a
              href="https://canadalearningcode.ca">CLC
              workshops</a>, and the marvelous people off <a href="https://.com">Stack Overflow</a>, I reached a
            reasonable level of proficiency. Exploring the far corners of the interwebs brought me even further, and now
            my father wants me to teach him. ðŸ™„ Currently deciding which JS framework to learn / stumbling through all
            the reviews on the interwebs.

          <p>Using Unity (nothing against Unreal, just what was shoved onto my computer), I've created several games to

          <p>After muddling my way through the beginner tutorials, I just generally do my own thing. Haven't done any
            games yet, but I'm definitely checking <a href="https://pygame.org">pygame out</a>. Right now, I'm working
            on making command line programs and other text-based programs. I just started learning Python, so I'm not as
            far along as website dev, but I'm making good progress. <a href="https://udemy.com">Udemy</a> has some good
            courses, as well as <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/">Udacity</a>. As well, because UBC offers a
            <a href="https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/">data science masters course</a>, I'm starting to look into
            machine learning and visualizing data and all that fun jazz.</p>

        <p>The University Transition Program is an intensive two year program that condenses the normal five year high
